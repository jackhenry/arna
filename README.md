<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About


Monorepo for several packages used to generate, manipulate, and render force directed graphs. 

`@arna/core` contains the definition for a simple
which can be used to declare graph nodes and edges. It also includes
the graph layout algorithm and graph data structures.

`@arna/edge-bundler` implements an optional graph edge bundling algorithm that may or may not be used when generated graphs.

`@arna/renderer` contains a graphics library independent interface which can be be extended to render a generated graph.
